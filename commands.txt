3. git add .
	- if any changes made, then add them to the tree/branch

4. git commit -m "message"
	- the added changes in the previous cmd are now made permanent

5. git restore --staged <filename>
	- if you want to remove the added file before commiting use this cmd.

6. git log
	- to check all the changes made

7. git reset <hash id of the commit>
	- when you want to reset your commits to a certain stage of project after making the changes, use this cmd to go back to that stage. It will remove the stages/commits made above this commit(copied hash id from)
